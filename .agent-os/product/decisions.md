## 2025-08-31: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Product  
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Create Py-SuperOps, a comprehensive Python SDK for the SuperOps API, targeting MSP developers and technicians with complete coverage of tickets, projects, and contracts functionality.

### Context

MSP teams currently struggle with complex GraphQL API integration, spending excessive time on basic SuperOps connectivity. The market lacks a Python-native SDK that provides SuperOps-specific abstractions and comprehensive API coverage. This creates an opportunity to significantly reduce development time for MSP automation projects.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic GraphQL Client Wrapper**
   - Pros: Faster initial development, leverages existing tools
   - Cons: Limited SuperOps-specific functionality, still requires GraphQL knowledge

2. **REST API Wrapper**
   - Pros: Simpler HTTP interactions, familiar patterns
   - Cons: SuperOps uses GraphQL primarily, would miss advanced features

3. **CLI-Only Tool**
   - Pros: Immediate utility for scripts and automation
   - Cons: Limited programmatic integration, doesn't serve developer use cases

### Rationale

Python SDK approach provides the best balance of ease-of-use and comprehensive functionality. MSP developers primarily work in Python for automation, and a native SDK will deliver the fastest development experience while covering all SuperOps API capabilities.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Dramatically reduced integration time for MSP developers
- Standardized SuperOps integration patterns across Python projects
- Strong foundation for MSP automation ecosystem growth

**Negative:**
- Requires ongoing maintenance as SuperOps API evolves
- Initial development investment in comprehensive API coverage
- Need to maintain compatibility across Python versions
