Product Requirements Document: py-superops API Client Enhancement
================================================================

Project: Complete SuperOps MSP API Python Client Library
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2025-08-31

Overview:
---------
Enhance the existing py-superops Python API client library to provide complete coverage of all SuperOps MSP API entities and endpoints. The library currently covers core entities (Clients, Tickets, Assets, Sites, Contacts, Knowledge Base) but lacks support for several critical MSP operations including Projects, Tasks, Contracts, Time Tracking, and administrative functions.

Current State:
--------------
The py-superops library has been successfully implemented with:
- Async-first architecture with GraphQL support
- Type-safe interfaces and comprehensive error handling
- Resource managers for 6 core entities
- Full CI/CD pipeline with security scanning
- 64 passing tests for core functionality

Missing Entities Requiring Implementation:
------------------------------------------

   - Create, read, update, delete projects
   - Link projects to clients and contracts
   - Project status management
   - Project task assignment
   - Project timeline and milestone tracking

2. Tasks API

    - Custom report builders
    - Report export formats
    - Report caching and optimization
    - Dashboard integration

11. Billing & Invoicing API
    - Invoice generation from time entries
    - Billing rate management
    - Invoice approval workflows
    - Payment tracking
    - Recurring billing setup

12. Inventory Management API

Technical Requirements:
-----------------------
- Maintain existing async-first architecture
- Follow established patterns from current managers
- Comprehensive type hints for all new entities
- GraphQL query builders for each entity
- Error handling consistent with existing patterns
- Minimum 80% test coverage for new code
- Documentation for all new endpoints
- Example usage for each new manager

Implementation Priority:
------------------------
High Priority (Core MSP Operations):
1. Projects API
2. Tasks API
3. Contracts API
4. Time Entries API

Medium Priority (Enhanced Functionality):
5. Enhanced Notes/Comments
6. Attachments/File Management
7. User Roles & Permissions
8. Webhooks API

Low Priority (Administrative):
9. Configuration Management
10. Reports API
11. Billing & Invoicing
12. Inventory Management

Success Criteria:
-----------------
- All identified API entities implemented with full CRUD operations
- Consistent API design following existing patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Documentation and examples for all new features
- Successfully integrated with existing CI/CD pipeline
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Performance benchmarks met or exceeded

Constraints:
------------
- Must maintain backward compatibility with v0.1.x
- Must follow SuperOps GraphQL schema exactly

- File uploads limited to REST endpoints only
- Must handle both US and EU datacenters

Deliverables:
-------------
- Enhanced py-superops library v0.2.0
- Complete API coverage for all SuperOps entities
- Comprehensive test suite
- Updated documentation
- Migration guide from v0.1.x to v0.2.0
- Example scripts for common workflows
